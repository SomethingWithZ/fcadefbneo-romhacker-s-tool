# fcadefbneo-romhacker-s-tool
IMPORTANT: THIS IS NOT A VERSION OFFICIALLY CREATED AND BACKED BY THE FIGHTCADE AND/OR FINALBURN NEO DEVELOPER TEAM. PROCEED WITH CAUTION.

This build of FCADEFBNEO was made for exclusively CPS3 ROMHACKING purposes.

(Included debug mode for those who would want it.)

In order to set up both or either executable, place it in your Fightcade\emulator\fbneo directory.

The Checksums are not unique, they are copies of other files within the file set. Ignore the errors from the new file checks and proceed.

Includes:

Redearth
jojo
SFIII
SFIII: 2ND IMPACT
SFIII: 3RD STRIKE
SFIII: 4RD STRIKE


Please contact me if any of the ROMs are missing. I may update it or exclude them from the list of inclusions.

It may be difficult to indicate whether or not the emulator is including the files.
