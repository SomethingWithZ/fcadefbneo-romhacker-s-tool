IMPORTANT: THIS IS NOT A VERSION OFFICIALLY CREATED AND BACKED BY THE FIGHTCADE AND/OR FINALBURN NEO DEVELOPER TEAM. PROCEED WITH CAUTION.

This build of FCADEFBNEO was made for exclusively CPS3 ROMHACKING purposes.

In order to set up this executable, place it in your Fightcade\emulator\fbneo directory.

The Checksums are not unique, they are copies of other files within the file set. Ignore the errors from the new file checks and proceed.

Please contact me if any of the ROMs are missing. I may update it or exclude them from the list of inclusions.

It may be difficult to indicate whether or not the emulator is including the files.
